## How to Compile & Execute

### Requirements
- **Compiler**: gcc -std=c99 nameOfFile -o whatYouWantTheExecutableToBeNamed
- **Dependencies**: None needed to be downloaded

### Compilation
```bash
make all
```
This will build both executables with the makefile and shoves the appropriate
contents into the other folders in this directory. You must create the bin,
obj, and obj2 folders in the same directory.
### Execution
```bash
make run
./bin/shell
```
This will run the shell program and start off with a slightly different prompt than
before. However, this will not create the mytimeout executable. Use make all and then
bin/shell to get back into the shell executable.
